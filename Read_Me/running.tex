\section{Running}
To run Scicopia it is necessary to run the ArangoDB and Elasticsearch servers first.
To run Scicopia on a development server, call the built-in server from the main directory.
\begin{verbatim}
set FLASK_APP=scicopia/flask_main
flask run
\end{verbatim}
For a production setup, it is possible to use a WSGI server with:
\begin{verbatim}
waitress-serve --host=localhost --call scicopia.flask_main:wsgi
\end{verbatim}
The optional parameters are shown with
\begin{verbatim}
waitress-serve --help
\end{verbatim}
and will not explained here, except for setting the port, which is \texttt{--port=}.\\
The address to connect to with the browser will be shown in the console after running the server.
