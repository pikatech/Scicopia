\section{Pre Installations}
To install Scicopia clone the git repository, change to the project main directory and install the requirements. 
\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/pikatech/Scicopia
cd Scicopia
pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{verbatim}
Scicopia uses two database systems to store the data needed. Firstly ArangoDB\footnote{\url{https://www.arangodb.com/}} to store bibliographic data and metadata of the documents, user data and link data for the graph. Secondly Elasticsearch\footnote{\url{https://www.elastic.co/}} for the search function. Accordingly it is necessary to install and set up these databases, load data into them (more in \nameref{prepros}) and run them before running Scicopia.
